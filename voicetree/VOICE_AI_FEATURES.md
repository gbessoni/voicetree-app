7. Add voice customization (speed, pitch, etc.)

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Start the server: `python app.py` from backend directory
3. Navigate to `/dashboard/{username}`
4. Test voice clone upload
5. Test link voice message generation
6. Test welcome message generation
7. Verify audio playback
8. Test edit/delete functionality
